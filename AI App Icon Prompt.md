I need you to generate a new icon for a keyboard.

Please adhere strictly to the following design requirements:

Core Style: The icon must be in a retro 8-bit pixel art style, reminiscent of icons from a vintage computer operating system from the 1990s.

Outlines: It must have thick, solid black outlines around all elements.

Pixelated: The image absolutely must have that pixelated look to match the rest of the icons and emulate the low resolution screens of the '90s. Therefor it must be exactly 64x64 pixels or at the very least *look* like it.

Color Palette: Use a limited color palette. Do not use bright or modern colors unless it is to highlight the uniqueness of the icon's main differentiating aspect to the other icons.

Shading & Texture: Use flat shading only. Do not use gradients. The solid colors should have the same subtle noise/paper texture seen in the reference images.

Perspective & Form: The design should be simple, clean, and two-dimensional (2D) from a front-facing perspective. The keyboard icon should inferred based on your ability to infer what an app like this is.

Text: The image should have no words, numbers, or text. Remember, this is an icon and will be too small for text to be legible
