## About FU TV

**FU TV is a Vancouver-based online station and website** that curates and produces local content. We showcase independent videos, films, music videos, and art made in and around Vancouver.

Creators keep full ownership, views, and monetization from their work — FU TV simply curates and streams it as part of our public playlist. You can submit your own content, watch what others are making in town, and be part of a growing lineup of Vancouver creators.

The station also features mini games, original FU TV productions and upcoming interactive updates designed to make local media fun, weird, and accessible.
